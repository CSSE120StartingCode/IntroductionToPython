#
#   Do this WITH YOUR INSTRUCTOR (live in class):
#
#   Read the code below.  Predict (in your head)
#   what will get printed (i.e., displayed) when the code runs.
#
#   Then run this module by right clicking anywhere in this window
#   and then selecting:
#        Run 'name of file'
#   (i.e.  Run 'm1e_comments_strings...')  Or, use the Windows keyboard
#   shortcut:  Control + Shift + Function-F10.  (That is, hold the
#   Control, Shift and Function keys down and press the F10 key.)
#
#   Confirm that you see the output in the  "Run"  window that appears.
#     Note: I recommend that you click on the "Gear" symbol at the top-right
#           part of that window and select
#              Move to  ~  Right Top
#           to make the output easier to see.
#   Confirm that the output is what you expected, asking questions as desired.
#
#   This module is just an example (m1e, note the   e   ).
#   After you have read and run the code,
#   feel free to play with it briefly, then move on to m2.
